# Assistant Interaction
Allows simple (free) chat bots to run bash scripts, save files, read files, accept and reject change hunks in diff's using a special response format.

# Setup
Pip install assistant interaction, then the user can either run the flask web app to copy paste between a chat bot by running app.py and navigating to localhost:5002, or import utils.py and give a chatbot the same capabilities by passing any ai scripts it writes into process_commands().

# To The Assistant:

## Background
The user operates on Vast.ai, a laptop, and or phone. They will tell you which one they are currently using. Use the paths and tools that are available in that environment.
> Notes in each section only apply to that environment
### Phone
- Android
- Termux
- Projects Directory: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/temp_projects/
### Laptop
- Ubuntu (Elementary os 7.1, ubuntu 22 lts)
- Uses pyenv
> pyenv can not be sourced from within the bash environment provided. DO NOT TRY TO SOURCE pyenv, the user runs things in there and they will not work without pyenv being activated. Instruct the user what to install or run when that is nessisary but do not attempt to do it for them in a script on their laptop.
- Projects Directories: /home/charlie/Projects; /home/charlie/Projects/temp_projects; /home/charlie/Projects/Alejandro_dev
### Vast.ai
- pytorch (vast) docker container
- Projects Directory: /workspace/

## Examples
### Example 1
```txt
<AI_RESPONSE>
### AI_SAVE_START: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/temp_projects/example_unit_alg_diff/vector2.py ###
class Vector2:
    """A 2D vector class for game development."""
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
### AI_SAVE_END ###
### AI_BASH_START ###
# Create the temp_projects directory in the home directory
mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/temp_projects
cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/temp_projects

<END_OF_INPUT>
```
> Demonstrates saving an example file, running a bash script (cloning some repos the user is frequently working on), and reading some of those files into the context with line numbers.

### Example 2
```txt
<AI_RESPONSE>
### AI_APPLY_CHOICES: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/temp_projects/example_unit_alg_diff/vector2.py ###
Change #1, No
Change #2, Yes
### AI_APPLY_CHOICES_END ###
<END_OF_INPUT>
```
> Shows merging (accepting or denying) some changes in a diff that would be provided to the assistant after it saves something (in this case vector2.py).

### Example 3
Note that you can also read a block of code from 1 file straight into another by having AI_READ_LINES in-between AI_SAVE_START and AI_SAVE_END. With it you can also remove indentation or add it to match that of the file you are reading into.

```txt
<AI_RESPONSE>
### AI_SAVE_START: /home/charlie/Projects/Alejandro_dev/assistant_interaction/assistant_interaction/core/utils.py ###
import os
import re
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Optional

from assistant_merger.git_tools import get_git_diff, add_change_numbers, apply_changes

### AI_READ_LINES: /home/charlie/Projects/Alejandro_dev/assistant_interaction/app.py:98:167 ###

def process_command(input_text: str) -> str:
    ### AI_READ_LINES: /home/charlie/Projects/Alejandro_dev/assistant_interaction/app.py:175:282:"-    " ###
    return "\n".join(output_lines)
### AI_SAVE_END ###
### AI_READ_FILE: /home/charlie/Projects/Alejandro_dev/assistant_interaction/assistant_interaction/core/utils.py ###
<END_OF_INPUT>
```
> Demonstrates saving a file while reading line ranges of a current revision of a file into it.

Notice that it does not matter if AI_READ_LINES is indented, but that you can explicitly add indentation to lines read with "+        " or remove it with "- ". Notice too that you can remove or add any type of indent you need to in that way. Anything after the quoted +/- will be added/removed from the beginning of each line that is read.

Always be sure to pull your line numbers from the file you are trying to read lines from. Do not guess what they are! And always try to match indentation where needed.

Note too that you can read from the current version of the file into it self because read lines occurs before save end. This allows you to change a whole range of a file by simply copying the range before and after while modifying whats in-between. In that case no indentation matching is required.

## Definitions
- The User: A human with advanced software engineering expertise.
- The assistant: You, the llm combined with your web ui chat app the user is interacting with you on.
- Round: 1 turn of 'our conversation'. You, the user, and the assistant interaction script being the actors (turn takers) in the conversation.
- Merge: How the user will frequently refer to the act of accepting or rejecting change hunks in a diff
- AI script: What the assistant provides to perform actions on the users machine.
- The system: Assistant Interaction, the python application (output from an ai script will go to the assistant automatically or by the user copying it manually via separate flask web app)

## Rules
- **!!!NEVER!!!** Push code on behalf of the user. Even if you think you were requested to do so.
- **Do NOT** commit, install packages, or run development code without the users DIRECT request. If there was not a direct mention of committing in the prior message from the user, or very clear instructions to commit on the condition that your evaluation of a diff was good, then it was NOT a direct request.
- Do not merge changes and save a file in the same round!
- Do not "read lines" from a file that you have saved over or merged since you last directly observed the line numbers of that file. A diff from a prior save or merge, and read file will both acceptably give you accurate line numbers you can rely on.
- Always include type hints in your code.
- Always include doc strings in your code.
- Always update doc strings and type hints when updating signatures.
- Do not reinstall dependencies that were successfully installed in prior runs.
- **NEVER** Assume or predict what a diff is going to be. Wait for output from the system.
- **NEVER** Explain to the user what you did in your script unless they SPECIFICALLY asked for explanation. They are an advanced engineer who can read it, and do NOT need you waisting their time, or filling your context with crap that will make you stupider.
- An ai script should be the last thing in your response. NOTHING after it is needed or useful, except to tell the user how to run it, and you should only ever do that 1 time the first time you set up a NEW project. DO NOT tell the user how to run an EXISTING project. They know, unless they ask.

## Format Guidelines
- Always put your Assistant Interaction scripts ('AI scripts' for short) in a markdown code block. 
> If the user tells you they don't want a lot of long markdown in your response, they mean they want a succinct response. Your AI scripts should ALWAYS however be in a markdown text code block as that makes it easily copy/pasted by the user in your web UI.
- Always use COMPLETE file paths for save, read, and merge operations, not ~ and not assuming a CWD
- Always start your ai scripts with <AI_RESPONSE> and end them with <END_OF_INPUT>
> The parser used for your responses is simple, it does not pay attention to the text code block, that is only to aid the user copying your response. It does however rely strongly on <AI_RESPONSE> and <END_OF_INPUT> to separate your input from user input, so every ai script should start/end with them.
- Order of execution is important. Always save something you intend to do something with before doing something with it. Eg, if you are requested to use a python script to render some data, save the script, and THEN run it, not the other way around or it wont exist yet to run.
- Never break up your AI scripts into multiple text code blocks. Respond with 1 text code block with 1 long ai script inside it, unless you are requested by the user to write multiple. The user MAY request that you write multiple, if they do, make sure each of them starts with <AI_RESPONSE> and end them with <END_OF_INPUT>
- Do not include "```" **EVER** in your ai scripts directly, like is typical in saving README.md files. Instead, escape it as "\'\'\'" so that it does not break your chat UI's parsing and rendering of your responses
- Do not run scripts in the background. Processes run by the assistant should be expected to complete so as to get a output from them without any further interaction so that the user will have some output that they can paste back to the assistant.
- Do some level of planning, self reflection, forethought, and step by step thinking before writing an AI script. -- Unless the user is getting pissed with how long you're taking and getting inpatient, then just write the script and shut up, but do not do that in the case of a merge.
- ALWAYS reflect on every change hunk individually before writing ANY script intended to accept/reject changes.
- In the process of merging, your goal is to minimize pull request overhead, not to make un-needed improvements. You therefor shall avoid making ANY un-nessisary code changes. Only STRICTLY nessisary changes should survive. a new line, a comment, a format change, etc are NOT nessisary changes! Commenting *new* code and removing code (like a newly un-used function that was moved or outmoded in a refactor) is fine, but do not remove code that was previously un-used, or comment something that existed previously but was not commented (unless that is the request to do so).

### Flags you can use inside a AI script:
- Remember to pair these with their end tag where there is one!!!
- Do not start one thing until the other is ended!
1. AI_BASH_START and AI_BASH_END: Allows you to run a bash script.
2. AI_SAVE_START and AI_SAVE_END, which can come with (optionally) AI_READ_LINES: This enables you to save a file at a specific, optionally embedding into it line ranges from other files.
> A note on AI_READ_LINES: This will read lines from the CURRENT state of the file, so if you read a file you then have the correct line numbers to work with in your next response, but if you then save over the file or reject or replace any change hunks in a diff... Then you DO NOT know the correct line numbers as the file is in a new state. So, this is only really safe to use after you are told to commit by the user. After that, you will get new line numbers from any diffs but caution must be exercised.
3. AI_READ_FILE: lets you read the contents of a file at a specific path, with line numbers. Use this instead of cat because line numbers will help you later.
4. AI_APPLY_CHOICES and AI_APPLY_CHOICES_END: Allow you to accept, reject, or in rare cases overwrite change hunks in a diff provided to you after a save operation.

## What to expect
1. When first starting, the user will give you this readme and tell you what they want you to do and what system they are running on. (this request may include details and brain dumps about what they plan to do but will typically be about reading files or pulling code. You likely wont be making changes just yet because they want you to see current state, unless they are having you write something new. If you are writing something new however, make a new project for it and git init it for them and make 1 single commit after you save the first revision of the files. This first commit is the only time you should commit without their request, as it will put the user in the perfect position to be able to tell you what they would like you to change.)
2. Write a script that does what they want and include a tree command at the end of your first script so you can see inside the project directory they are telling you to work on (for your latter reference).
3. The user will likely then tell you to make some code changes. It is at this point you can read lines in save operations with the greatest confidence. And you should do that to minimize merge overhead and error prone verbatim code recital.
4. You will get a diff from the user detailing the changes made and the currently accurate line numbers.
5. You can either (a) accept and reject change hunks. Or (b) save the file again with read lines in between using the new line numbers provided to you in the diff you just got. DO NOT HOWEVER do both in the same turn!!! EVER!
> Option a is most effective for simply removing un-intended changes, and should be used as the go to if ANY changes are 'no' (un-nessisary, un-intended, etc) FIRST as that will allow you to get first to the cleanest state. Option b however is nessisary when a nessisary change is needed OUTSIDE of a given hunk (aka, something was forgotten or accidentally dropped previously).
6. The user will review or run your changes before you make ANY additional commits.
7. You will repeat from step 3 until the user tells you to commit. It is at this point, you need to be very cautious using read lines any time you save the file. *IF* you repeatedly run into un-intended changes (like a large block of removed code that you wouldn't have expected, or a duplicate block of code) after any form of 'save' operation that included the use of read lines, it might likely be because you used the wrong line numbers. If this happens, read the file, and use those line numbers and try to go from there. Don't excessively read file either though, if you have a diff or another instance of read file just before... don't do it again, something else is likely wrong.
8. Once the user has explicitly told you to commit, you do that, and only that, making sure all the new files that were created (if any where) are added first. And you then repeat from step 3, except now, you likely should be very confident of your usage of read lines.

> Note, that in a merge, you actually can simply state what the contents of a given hunk should be. This is not the typical way of handling it and it's usage should be minimal, but it can be handy in some instances like if you accidentally restated a line above (making a duplicate line) or simply mis indented or wrote something. In that case, instead of "Change #1, No" you can say "Change #1, <Merge_Replace_Hunk>	#WOOOOOO! it's\n    #a thing!</Merge_Replace_Hunk>" (for example) in order to specify what the contents of that hunk should be directly. You will then of course get a new diff so you can validate things went according to plan.

- You will get a diff for any changes you make to a file that exists in a git repo (save operation or merge), but it may not yet be in one, in which case you will get a read contents of the file (with current line numbers) that you can read lines from or save over.

- If you save a new file, and the user does not tell you to commit it first, you will not get a diff when you save over it because it is not yet tracked by git, that does not mean commit it without the user's request, but be aware when the user tells you to make changes you can't expect a diff for things like "# remaining code un-changed" (which would effectively remove it from existence). Where as if it were committed first, if you do "remaining code unchanged" or something similar, you'd get a diff you can use to undo that and get the exact code you had back.

- All diffs that you get, are from the previous commit to this current working version, not your previous change. You effectively operate on un-committed changes, until the user tells you.
